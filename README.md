**Turn your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent into a Home Assistant voice assistant.**

Say a wake word, ask a question, get a spoken answer — powered by your own OpenClaw agent with all its tools, memory, and personality.

```
"Hey Nabu" → Whisper STT → OpenClaw Agent → Piper TTS → Speaker
```

## What you get

- Your full OpenClaw agent as a HA conversation agent
- Voice control through HA Voice PE, phone app, or browser
- Works with any STT/TTS engine (Whisper, Piper, HA Cloud...)
- Simple setup: just point it at your OpenClaw Gateway

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the 3 dots menu > **Custom repositories**
3. Add `nicolasglg/openclaw-conversation` as **Integration**
4. Search for and install **OpenClaw Conversation**
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Add Integration** > **OpenClaw Conversation**

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/openclaw_conversation` into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory and restart.

## Configuration

### 1. Add the integration

**Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > OpenClaw Conversation**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Display name (e.g. "OpenClaw") |
| Gateway URL | `http://<gateway-ip>:<port>` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:18789`) |
| API Token | Your gateway auth token |
| Model | `openclaw` (default) |
| Timeout | `30` seconds |

### 2. Set up a Voice Assistant

**Settings > Voice Assistants** > create or edit an assistant:

- **Conversation agent**: select **OpenClaw**
- **Speech-to-Text**: Whisper, Faster Whisper, or HA Cloud
- **Text-to-Speech**: Piper, Google Translate, or HA Cloud
- **Wake word**: e.g. "Ok Nabu" via openWakeWord

### 3. Assign to a voice device

For HA Voice PE or other satellites: set **Preferred Assistant** to your OpenClaw assistant in the device settings.

### 4. Test it

Say the wake word and speak, or use **Voice Assistants > Start a conversation** to test via text.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw Gateway](https://openclaw.ai) with Chat Completions endpoint enabled
- Home Assistant 2024.1+
- HACS installed

### Enable Chat Completions on your gateway

Add this to your `openclaw.json` inside the `gateway` block:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your gateway after the change.

### Network notes

- HA must reach your OpenClaw Gateway over HTTP
- If they're on different machines, use the gateway's LAN IP (not `127.0.0.1`)
- Open port `18789` (default) if needed
- Docker users: `127.0.0.1` refers to the container, use the host's LAN IP instead

## STT / TTS recommendations

### Speech-to-Text

| Engine | Speed | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **HA Cloud** | Fast | Requires subscription |
| **Faster Whisper** (Wyoming) | Good | Separate machine with decent CPU/GPU |
| **Whisper** (local add-on) | Slow on weak HW | Not ideal on HA Green / Pi |

### Text-to-Speech

| Engine | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Piper** (local) | Good, natural | Lightweight, runs anywhere |
| **HA Cloud** | Excellent | Requires subscription |
| **Google Translate TTS** | Decent | Needs internet |

> **Tip**: On HA Green or Raspberry Pi, local Whisper will be slow. Use Faster Whisper on a separate machine or HA Cloud.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Cannot connect to gateway | Check URL: `curl http://<ip>:<port>/v1/chat/completions`. Check firewall. Don't use `127.0.0.1` across machines. |
| Endpoint disabled (405) | Enable `chatCompletions` in `openclaw.json`, restart gateway |
| Invalid auth (401) | Check token. Ensure `gateway.auth.mode` is `"token"` |
| Red flashing light (Voice PE) | STT failed — check your STT engine config |
| Agent not in dropdown | Restart HA after installing. Check logs for errors |

## Known limitations

- **Response latency**: Full pipeline (STT > LLM > TTS) takes a few seconds. Local Whisper on low-powered devices adds delay.
- **No continuous conversation**: Wake word needed after each response (HA pipeline limitation).
- **No audio streaming**: Responses are fully generated before being spoken.
